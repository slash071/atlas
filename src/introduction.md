# Atlas: A Learning Journey

_by Mohammadreza Roosta_

Welcome to _Atlas_. This book documents my personal learning journey, capturing key concepts and skills I’ve explored across a variety of topics.

## Why Atlas?

I created Atlas as a way to chart and reflect on the lessons I’ve learned along the way. Just as an atlas maps out the world, this book maps out the knowledge and discoveries that have shaped my growth. I hope it will also serve as a guide for others who are on similar journeys of self-discovery and learning.

## How to Use Atlas

You can approach Atlas however it best suits your needs. Whether you choose to follow it chapter by chapter or dive into the sections that most interest you, each part stands on its own as a guide. Consider it a companion along your own journey of discovery, providing clarity and perspective when you need it.

I hope you enjoy Atlas and that it helps you in your journey of discovery.
