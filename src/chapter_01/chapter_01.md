## What is Markdown

Markdown is a writing format compared to a publishing format like HTML or PDF. A writing format serves as the original source for a written document, such as a blog post. Markdown is based on plain text and is human-readable. As a minimal markup language, it provides a simple and compact syntax (formatting) that doesn’t get in the way of your content.

Markdown is a lightweight open-source markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext documents.

## Flavors of Markdown

There are several variations of Markdown. As such, Markdown does not have an official standard format. There are four major variations of Markdown that we can explore:

- Markdown (Original, John Gruber)
- Enhanced Versions
  - Markdown Extra
  - MultiMarkdown
  - GitHub Flavored Markdown
  - Several More

> Probably the most commonly used flavor today is the one used by GitHub.

## Why Markdown

- Markdown is a simple format based on plain text that any editor can read and edit.
- The format is lightweight, meaning it has minimal effect on the original content.
- Markdown has become widely supported, with editors available on nearly every platform and device.
- Use it for writing and publishing to HTML, PDF, or other formats.

As stated above, you should use Markdown as your source writing format and then utilize tools to publish your content into various other formats as needed. For example, you can publish to HTML for a blog post or create a PDF document for printing, or both from the same Markdown document.
