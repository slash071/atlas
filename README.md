# Atlas: A Learning Journey

_A curated collection of knowledge and discoveries_

Atlas is a personal project documenting my learning journey across various technologies and concepts. This repository serves as both a learning journal and a reference guide, mapping out the essential topics I've explored in fields.

Each section in Atlas dives into key ideas, from foundational concepts to more advanced techniques. Whether you're a beginner exploring new technologies or an experienced professional needing a quick reference, Atlas is designed to support diverse learning needs.

## How to Use Atlas

You can use Atlas in two main ways:

- **Sequentially**: Follow the topics in the order theyâ€™re presented to gain a structured understanding of each subject.
- **On-demand**: Jump directly to the sections that interest you, using Atlas as a reference for specific topics.

Each chapter is self-contained, making it easy to explore one section without needing to fully read the others.

## Accessing Atlas

Atlas is accessible in two convenient ways:

- Online: You can read Atlas on [GitHub Pages](https://slash071.github.io/atlas/), making it easy to access from anywhere.
- Locally: For offline access, you can build and serve the book on your computer.

To view Atlas locally, follow these steps:

1. Install [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/slash071/atlas.git
```

3. Navigate into the project directory and serve the book:

```bash
cd atlas
mdBook serve --open
```

This will host Atlas on a local server, which you can view in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

Both the online and local methods provide the same content; choose whichever is most convenient.
